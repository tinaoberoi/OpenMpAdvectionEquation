# Project 1

## Serial Implementation

File `my_advection_program.c` contains the implementation of Advection Pseducode.

Commands to run the code:
`gcc my_advection_program.c -o my_advection_program -lm`
`./my_advection_program 400 10000 1.0 1.0e6 5.0e-7 2.85e-7`

The code will generate a guassian.txt (containing the initial values) and timestamp.txt (containing the values for selected n).

## Plotting

The plots are present in the `plots` folder for timestamps:
[100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 5000, 8000, 9000, 9500]

A gif is present as output.gif file created using the above mentioned plots.
